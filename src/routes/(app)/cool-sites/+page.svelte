<h1>Cool Sites</h1>

<p>
    Like most pages on this site, this is mostly self-indulgent in that it's
    more for me than anyone else. It's a reference to a bunch of cool websites
    that I want to have a link to. You'd think I could just have bookmarks for
    them but that sounds like a normal person way to manage these.
