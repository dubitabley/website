    As per
    <a href="https://nownownow.com/about"> this now page </a>
    I must slavishly follow by adding a page that indicates what I'm up to. I doubt
    anyone cares but it's useful for myself to keep myself organised and thinking
    about what I'm up to.

    Currently: <br />

    Falling down a pit of failure
</p>

<p>
    Playing a lot of <a href="https://momentum-mod.org/">Momentum Mod</a> which
    is really fun but a little too addicting, rocket jumping is so good but it
    does make me want to wall jump off of large buildings
    <abbr title="In real life">IRL</abbr> which is probably an unhealthy impulse.
</p>

<p>
    Stuck in a rut in general, I like to work on random things but I don't
    really have motivation for anything; can't finish a lot of the things I want
    to; can't start anything without finishing them first.

    Want to set up an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> reader for
    reading people's swag blogs. Would also be nice to setup my own RSS feed for the
    sake of it but idk.
