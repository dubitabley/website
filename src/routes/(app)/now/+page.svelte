    As per
    <a href="https://nownownow.com/about"> this now page </a>
    I must slavishly follow by adding a page that indicates what I'm up to. I doubt
    anyone cares but it's useful for myself to keep myself organised and thinking
    about what I'm up to.

    Currently: <br />

    Drowning in a metaphorical pool of nothingness
</p>

<p>
    Playing a lot of <a href="https://momentum-mod.org/">Momentum Mod</a> which
    is really fun but a little too addicting, rocket jumping is so good but it
    does make me want to wall jump off of large buildings
    <abbr title="In real life">IRL</abbr> which is probably an unhealthy impulse.
</p>

<p>
    Stuck in a rut in general, I like to work on random things but I don't
    really have motivation for anything; can't finish a lot of the things I want
    to; can't start anything without finishing them first.

    Messed around with 3d css stuff, look at <a href="/css3d">this page lol.</a>

<p>Trying to read Asimov's Foundations books</p>
