    As per
    <a href="https://nownownow.com/about"> this now page </a>
    I must slavishly follow by adding a page that indicates what I'm up to. I doubt
    anyone cares but it's useful for myself to keep myself organised and thinking
    about what I'm up to.

    Still lost...

    Recently watched the third season of the Alex Rider TV show which was kinda
    silly. It's obviously MI6 propaganda and ridiculous (in the sense that it's
    kinda teen wish fulfilment) and also diminished a little by the fact that I
    still remember the books well enough to know what the twists in it are. I
    will say that the music in it is pretty good.

    Stuck in a rut in general, I like to work on random things but I don't
    really have motivation for anything; can't finish a lot of the things I want
    to; can't start anything without finishing them first.
