        This will potentially be just a stream of consciousness since I don't
        have a specific topic to talk about. The general throughline should be
        about "blogging", this hip new thing I hear all the kids are excited
        about but it should discuss some other topics about this website and
        what I want to do with it.

        Blogs are an interesting form of communication that are basically unique
        to the internet. Previously people might give public speeches or write
        letters or pamphlets etc. but none have the same purpose or use case as
        a blog. The etymology as a weblog which is shortened
        <Footnote>
            Apparently it's called rebracketing or metanalysis according to <a
                href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blog#English"
                >Wiktionary here</a
            >
            which is quite interesting.
        </Footnote>
        to blog explains its origins to some extent but it's not really a log. It's
        more a medium of communication that could be about anything. They tend to
        be personal and semi-regular.

    <h3>Some issues with blogs.</h3>
    <div>
        Blogs are cool but I have various gripes with them. One issue is that
        people don't know when a new one is published. The solutions to this are
        either custom tech solutions that combine them into a feed that can be
        read.
        <Footnote>
            The main way of doing this is <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a
            > which is cool but people don't really seem to use it that much. I don't
            either so I can't say much about it.
        </Footnote>
        However unless this is trivial to setup most people won't. (When I say most
        people I usually mean me as a substitute for the common person) The other
        way of publicising blog posts are just telling people about it on other social
        media platforms so they can see it but this makes it dependent on other sources.
        The key there is to hook into people's daily habits so they can have the
        chance of viewing something they might find interesting.
        <br />
        Another problem with blogging as a writing form is just that writing and
        reading long form doesn't seem to be in vogue. I think that blogs can incorporate
        multimedia aspects though; images, videos or sounds could accentuate or help
        to explain certain concepts if used well. Ultimately people will always want
        to read good writing I believe. Probably there should be some payoff in terms
        of something learned or some great insight which leans into the next point.
        <br />
        The other issue is to do with always needing to produce or publish or drown.
        This is an issue about "content" in general, accentuated heavily by the internet
        and the way in which websites' algorithms work and it has many negative consequences.
        It's why youtubers will publish lazy videos for the sake of putting out a
        video rather than something that's meaningful. In some way that's inevitable
        for anyone who does it as a job though. People don't do blogging as a career
        though, except in cases where people might write on behalf of a corporation
        which has a very distinct feel and purpose.

    <h3>How it is to be</h3>

        I don't have dates on any of the pages on this site since I think a
        website should be a living thing that evolves and changes. I think my
