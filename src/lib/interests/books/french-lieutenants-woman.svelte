    An interesting book. I've enjoyed other books written by John Fowles
    and this was also fascinating. An examination of Victorian life in England
    especially bourgeois society while being willing to examine the contradictions in it.
    This is a short review of the novel, will contain spoilers of the book.

<h4>A brief synopsis</h4>
<p>
    As a short summary of the plot, a wealthy aristocratic man named Charles Smithson is engaged to the daughter of a
    wealthy businessman but he becomes intrigued by a woman who is seemingly depressed and living in the same quiet Lyme town 
    as him called Sarah Woodruff who is the title character that the book is named after. 
    However nothing is as it seems with Sarah and as he becomes more entangled with her, we get an 
    examination of Victorian attitudes and beliefs as well as our own society's views.

    Like other books by Fowles he deliberately deploys ambiguity in the events of the story at times to 
    hide the characters' intent and to demonstrate the lack of a singular truth or manner of interpreting events.

    I am not good at writing reviews but I think this book is worth writing one about, partially because I want to 
    improve at writing and expressing myself in words which is more difficult than it seems it should be. On a related theme, 
    one technique Fowles employs frequently is intentionally acknowledging how the novel is written and writing from the 
    point of view of the author narrating their decisions made in crafting the text as it is written so directly that 
    it makes the reader aware of the writer writing not just the story but writing about writing the story. The narrator
    of the story is almost a character on their own as they have their own agency in the text.
    They sometimes drop little sections or whole chapters dedicated to this, one such is where the narration calls
    Sarah the 'protagonist' near the end of the novel. This is despite the whole text following Charles and his decisions 
    throughout and makes us doubt who and what the text is truly about. Even though it seems to be a standard male
    dominated text where the main character is the only one with agency, both in decision making but also in terms of 
    monetary and societal power. Both Sarah and the Cockney servant Sam do actually make choices that impact Charles demonstrating
    how he isn't the only character who matters despite the narrative following him and his thinking.

    At the start of each chapter there are some short excerpts from a poem or text (apparently called an 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigraph_(literature)">epigraph</a>), 
    most of which are written during the Victorian era around the 1850s. The quotes range from poems by Tennyson and 
    A.H. Clough or quotes from seminary works by Charles Darwin and Karl Marx. My interpretation of these quotes is to centre the text in 
    the timeframes, to show the intellectual beliefs and ideas of the time; it demonstrates the changing attitudes
    as Darwin's ideas appear as a motif within the book to contrast the more traditionalist bourgeois Charles who is more willing
    to adopt these ideas which seek to upend large parts of the base of society with the more enterprising Mr. Freeman who rejects 
    Darwin's concepts since he prefers the new commercial order being constructed where people like him could join the nouveau riche
    The only epigraph not from that range is one from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_a_President">a book about the 
    assassination of JFK</a> where Jackie Kennedy says "Let them see what they have done"
    Why this moment should be prioritised as the only quote outside of the 19th century I am not sure. The chapter in question (chapter 20) deals with 
    Sarah explaining her backstory and being dishonoured and how she came to be known as the French Lieutenant's Woman since she had had 
    an affair with a french man who told her that he was a lieutenant but was deceiving her.

    Conclusion

<p>
    I don't know what the intention for this essay/review is, but it gives a way for me to express some of my thoughts on this book which I read
    and thought was cool. Maybe I can look back on it later and refine some of these points or structure it in a more detailed way that not only 
    makes points about the book.
