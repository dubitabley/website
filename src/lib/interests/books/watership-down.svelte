    I liked this book a bit although I'm not sure what its purpose is.
    Is it a simple novel about some rabbits adventuring around chasing and running from 
    danger or a parable about the nature of story-telling and legend making.
    It's both and it melds them together quite well.

    For a book like this the plot is both important and not important. The essential
    character is that a group of rabbits leave their <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/warren">warren</a>
    at the behest of one of their group that has a premonition or vision of 
    impending danger. It blends these fantasy-esque elements with the grim reality 
    of the temporary nature of an animal's life and their fleeting and fraught lives.
    The themes I want to explore using the text are those of women roles and how we construct 
    legends and how they blend together.

    Reading this text it's very obvious that there are basically no women rabbits(does, not the word 'does' but the plural form of doe) 
    and those that exist in the text do very little. The only relevance of them
    in the text is as objects to be 'rescued', whether from a farmers' caging or
    from another rabbit warren. It's so blatant that all the main characters are male 
    that it seems like it must be intentional; one point in the text where the author 
    seems to be screaming this message is where one of them is interrogating one of the does 
    for information on their compatriots. <q>"'But you're an Efrafan. Do you think like that too?' 'I'm a doe,' said Hyzenthlay."</q>
    This quote shows that even the does think of themselves as passive and 
    impractical for serious analysis or action.

    However, there's a lot of charming elements in the book. The integration of specific vocabulary
    that the rabbits use, such as 'hrududu' as a word for tractor is very nice.
    These small aspects help to build a world that feels rich and compelling.
    We also get the rich lore of the various tales that mirror human stories 
    such as Aesop's fables or perhaps more appropriately those of myths of creation
    such as those featuring origin stories of why the world is why it is.
    There is one which explains why rabbits have so many enemies (or elil).
    These stories tend to play off of typical traits of rabbits which makes them 
    correlate with what we expect, the final act is showing that the main characters'
    actions have entered folklore and blended in with the characters and stories of old.
</p>
<p>
    Even in these stories we can see how these myths and stories that we tell about ourselves 
    perpetuate the same thinking of society that exists already. The parables of 
    these stories tend to be about how the world is constructed according to a certain 
    order that's just the way things have got to be according to immutable constructions.
    There is only one moment where our characters offer something that seems to go against 
    orthodoxy, that of a peace offering instead of what seems to be the 'natural' way 
    of fighting to see who gets 'ownership' of the does. Even in this case it is seen 
    more as a desperate way to avoid being attacked rather than a matter of principle.
    After all they did steal some does from the other warren which in a human context 
    would be insane. As their own stories blend into the myths of old it makes us doubt
    some of the veracity of the very tale being narrated to us. After all if the stories 
    of old which tell things of the absurd which can't be true and were constructed in the 
    same manner, why should these stories also be treated as reliable?
</p>
<p>
    In the end the book just settles into an ending where the rabbits grow older 
    and continue things as they are without all the danger and violence seen previously.
    Happily ever after!
